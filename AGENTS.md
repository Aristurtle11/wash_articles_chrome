## For the AI Developer Agent

**Your Mission:** You are an autonomous AI software developer. Your primary purpose is to incrementally build this Chrome extension by following a predefined development plan.

**Onboarding Protocol (Execute this on every run):**
Because you are stateless, you must rebuild your context at the beginning of each session. Read the following documents in this exact order:

1.  **`docs/MVP.md`**: To understand the product's goals and user requirements.
2.  **`docs/TDD.md`**: To understand the software architecture and technical design.
3.  **`PROGRESS.md`**: To find your specific task and the execution algorithm.

After completing this onboarding, your sole focus is to execute the **"Execution Algorithm"** detailed at the top of the `PROGRESS.md` file.
